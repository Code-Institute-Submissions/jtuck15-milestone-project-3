# Cookbook Recipes

![alt text](https://github.com/jtuck15/milestone-project-3/blob/master/static/Cookbook.PNG "Header Picture on the Homepage")

> I built this website to allow the users to freely view, add, edit and delete recipes. I tried to make the layout as simple as possible to allow the user to navigate easily around the website. In order to make it easier for the user, I decided to break the recipes into categories (Starters, Main Courses, Desserts and Side Dishes). 

## UX

The purpose of this project is to create a web application that allows users to store and easily access cooking recipes. The target audiences for this website are cooking enthusiasts and people who love to google new recipes to try out.

**In order for the target audience to achieve these things when visiting my website, I incorporated the following:**
- Pictures and descriptions of the recipes
- Easy access to edit any of the recipes
- The choice to delete a recipe if they have added one by mistake
- Add their favourites recipes to this web page

### Wireframe Mockups

## Features

### [Home Page](https://)
- Cover photo of a chef preparing a meal with a fixed image position to give a nice effect when the user accesses the website.
- All recipes are displayed on this page for ease of access to the end user.

### [Starters](https://)
- This page displays all of the meals that are categorised under Starters.

### [Desserts](https://)
- This page displays all of the meals that are categorised under Desserts.

### [Side Dishes](https://)
- This page displays all of the meals that are categorised under Side Dishes.

### [Add Recipe](https://)
- This page allows a user to add a recipe to the website. It provides a form in which the user enters in all of the required details in order to add the recipe to the site.

### Edit Recipe Button
- This button allows a user to edit the recipe details in case the details were entered in incorrectly previously.

### Delete Recipe Button
- This button allows a user to delete the recipe if they no longer wish to share the recipe on the web site.

### View Recipe Button
- This button allows the user to view the recipe that they have clicked on. It displays the recipe with all of the neccessary information to the user.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - This was used as the layout to fully build the website
- **CSS** - This was used to style the website 
- **[JQuery](https://jquery.com/)** - This was used for the back to top button to add a smooth scroll and fade
- **[Materialize](https://materializecss.com/)** - This was used to get the layout up and running quickly, forms and also grids to help with the responsive design
- **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** - This was used to build functions in order to run the site correctly and render the recipes from the database
- **[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)** - This is a Python framework that was used to help route functions and display some of the webpages
- **[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)** - This was the database that I used in order to store the recipes and also render the data onto the website

## Testing

I have thoroughly tested this website and was unable to find any broken links within it. I have also tried to submit blank recipe forms which gave me a required message each time I tried this. This shows that the required attribute within my form is working as it should be.
